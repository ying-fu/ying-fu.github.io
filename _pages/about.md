I am currently a professor with the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology. I received the B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Xidian University in 2009, the M.S. degree in Automation from Tsinghua University in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in information science and technology from the University of Tokyo in 2015. My research interests include computer vision, image and video processing, and computational photography.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
